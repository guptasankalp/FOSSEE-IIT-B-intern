# FOSSEE-intern
Submission Assignment by Sankalp Gupta
Sankalp Gupta : Jaipur engineering college & research centre ,jaipur

I tried to attempt Part A and get positive outcome .
I was having neither background of scilab nor Matlab but I explore the basics of Matlab.
Practising From basics to Standard question ,I got confidence to appear for the test.
Here, in assignment 2 of part A , I uses addme() function in Matlab code .
learning basics of conversion from mathworks.com, I just translate the code to fossee_asgnmnt2.c file .

Then in scilab 5.5.2 ,I direct convert matlab code to scilab .

Problem : we have to use "coder" library for converting matlab/scilab to .c file which is not available in matlab 7.3(2006) and latest version is not available to me .
